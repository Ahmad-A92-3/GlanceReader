OpenSpritz-Android is a Spritz-like .epub reader for Android. Inspired by Miserlou's [OpenSpritz](https://github.com/Miserlou/OpenSpritz).

## Lend a hand

+ It'd be nice to digest `http://...` share intents, parse & spritz the resulting page.
+ Progress indicator?
+ More sophisticated pivot choosing.

#### A Note About the Name

OpenSpritz has nothing to do with [Spritz Incorporated](http://www.spritzinc.com/). This is an open source, community created project, made with love because Spritz is such an awesome technique for reading with.
